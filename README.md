Hello! I'm Mohammad Zaatari, a Software Developer based in Saida. I've remotely crafted projects for agencies, and collaborated with incredible talents to create impactful digital products for both business and consumer use. As a USAID scholar and computer scientist at the American University of Beirut, I have a passion for generating endless
creative ideas and bringing them to life through deliberate and thoughtful implementation. I invest time in learning and researching to ensure the optimal execution of each project. With my technical skills in software/web development, and algorithm/data structure design, I’m equipped to turn these ideas into tangible results. I’m committed to delivering high quality work and continuously expanding my knowledge to improve and innovate. I’m excited to collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. I'm deeply immersed in the digital product world, having explored hundreds of web and mobile apps across various industries and verticals over the years. Your web and app needs are in expert hands with me. Visit my portfolio here:
